# Watchdog-wt
Watchdog Wintertodt attacks

This is for the Runelite plugin "Watchdog" https://github.com/adamk33n3r/runelite-watchdog

This will notify you when the Brazier is getting attacked. There is a limitation of the plugin that makes it so the "brazier" being attacked will also have the "fire attack" alert go off. It will also trigger with the ground snow attacks as well, but its better than nothing.

There are two Brazier attacks, I've labeled them as such: The Brazier cracking is "Brazier attack" and the Fire going out is "Fire attack".

To install copy the text from the "WT Attack" file and import it into Watchdog
